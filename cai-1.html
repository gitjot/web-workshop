    <h1>Computer Aided Instruction v1</h1>
    
    <p>Open your console (CTRL+SHIFT+I) and follow the instructions</p>
    
    <h2>NEXT STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Change the way the question is displayed e.g. <i>4 x 2</i> instead of <i>4 times 2</i> </li>
      <li>Modify the program so that the responses for an incorrect answer vary randomly as follows: </li>
      <ul>
        <li>No. Please try again</li>
        <li>Wrong. Try once more</li>
        <li>Donâ€™t give up</li>
        <li>No. Keep trying.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>At the end of the processing ask the user if they want to go again ... Keep going as long as user says Y </li>
      <li>Add an option to allow the user to pick difficulty level. <br>
        1=single digit problems; 2=double digit problems; 3=mixed digit problems</li>
      <li>Add an option to allow the user to pick the type of arithmetic problems.<br>
        1=addition; 2=subtraction; 3=multiplication; 4=division; 5=random mixture</li>
      <li>Add a statistics feature e.g. #questions, #correct/incorrect answers <br>
          When will you display these? At the end? Ongoing, after each answer?</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Rewrite the program so that it doesn't use any global variables <br>
          (Hint: it may be helpful to define your own object(s))</li>
      <li> Suggest ways to improve the user experience <br>
        (Hint: would it be useful to provide a help/hint facility?)</li>
      <li>Suggest ways to improve the user interface<br>
        (Hint: what about a using a web page?)</li>
    </ol>
